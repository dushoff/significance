There is apparently a book called What if there were no significance tests?

Bernardi et al. 2017 
* Present an analysis of the presence of errors in the interpretation of 
results and ambiguity in language focused on NHST. Similar to the results from a similar review in the field of economics Ziliak and McCloskey 2008.


Robinson 2001, which arose from Jones 2000
* [instead of no difference, or no statistical difference] "authors should instead simply state that `the direction of the differences among the treatments was undetermined' or that `the sign of the correlation among the two variables was undetermined.'" --- That is, "If p is greater than 0.05, the conclusion is simply that the sign of the difference is not yet determined"


Gelman and Stern 2006
* Paragraph removed from text, could be added back: Another common mistake is using a larger p~value as stronger evidence for accepting the null hypothesis. A larger p value actually corresponds to less clarity and thus the possibility of an undetected larger effect (see Table~1 for an example). In 2006 Gelman and Stern wrote that the difference between statistically significant and statistically non-significant is notitself significant. Rewritten using ``clarity'' this statement indicates that if a single result is not statistically clear, any comparison made between that unclear result and a clear result will not itself be a clear comparison. An example taken from the literature is in Table~1.

	* ``I’d like to propose that simple “comparison of means” experiments (those analyzed with a t-test or ANOVA) train our brains to think that this is the goal of science – to discover if an effect exists. --- But the goal of our science should be mechanistic and predictive models that make quantitative predictions that might be tested with experiments.''
	* ``The absurdity of the t-test or  ANOVA way of doing science is apparent if something like temperature and CO2 are the experimental factors – for example in the many global climate change studies. What in ecology or physiology or cell biology is not related to temperature and CO2?''
