Dear Editor:

Please accept the enclosed manuscript, “I can see clearly now: reinterpreting statistical significance”, for consideration for publication in _Ecology_.

Debates about the role of the P value in statistical hypothesis testing have continued for many decades, but misuse of P values continues to plague ecology (and other fields). There has been a recent wave of concern about these issues. Recent suggestions for mitigating the problems include: abandoning statistical significance entirely; switching to Bayesian or information-theoretic approaches; or making the default p-value threshold more stringent. Opponents argue that scientists are too conservative to change, or that human nature will lead to abuse of any statistical methodology. Here we propose a simple, practical step forward: stop talking about statistical “significance” and call it “clarity” instead. This protocol can be implemented now, at low cost, and will immediately improve the interpretation of statistical tests.

In ecology, we usually know that differences we are measuring are not exactly zero. We don’t test the null hypothesis to learn whether it is true; we test as a convenient way to evaluate whether we have clearly _seen_ a difference. In other words, what we call statistical “significance” has more to do with clarity than with significance. We believe that statistical practice could be improved by:

* Recognizing that most null-hypothesis testing is about evaluating whether we’ve seen something clearly, in a particular data set
* Replacing the language of statistical “significance” with statistical “clarity”

The enclosed submission lays out this position, illustrating it with examples from the literature – misinterpretations of the meaning of statistical tests that become easier to interpret and explain when viewed through the lens of “statistical clarity”.

We're aware that this is an atypical submission for _Ecology_, but we think we have a clear, valuable contribution to an issue that is important to your readers. We have informally discussed this submission with Gordon Fox and Brian Inouye, who were both supportive of submitting.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.

Jonathan Dushoff, Morgan Kain and Ben Bolker
