\begin{itemize}
  \item Examples

  \subitem Lack of clarity differentiating between biological and statistical significance: {Simonetal.2017}

  \subitem Setting out to accept the null: \citep{Karulinetal.2015}
  \subitem ``...establish the \emph{a priori} selection of an effect level that is considered unacceptably toxic:'' \citep{Dentonetal.2011}
  \subitem With the \emph{correlation coefficient} for males and females (but significance for only one sex---``substrate 
  choice correlated significantly with food choice in males'') the authors go on to describe biologically why the 
  correlation would be significant for males but not females.
