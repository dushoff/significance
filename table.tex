The finding that species richness showed no significant relationship with the area of available habitat is surprising because richness is usually strongly influenced by landscape context

\ldots risk of low BMD [bone mineral density] remained greater in HCV-coinfected women versus women with HIV alone
(adjusted OR 2.99, 95\% CI 1.33–6.74), but no association was found between HCV coinfection and low BMD in men 
(adjusted OR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.75–2.10). \ldots 
The precise mechanisms for the association between viral hepatitis and low BMD in HIV-infected women but not men remain unclear.
