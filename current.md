I updated the MS and updated the git_push. Diffs now reflect changes I made recently in response to Morgan's comments. At some point I can switch to a diff from submitted version (not sure if that's required).

* <git_push/>
* <rebuttal.md>

Next steps:
* Decide something about cover letter, Ben's overarching point
	* This might depend somewhat on the resubmit interface, I'm happy to stay out of it
* Update the word count (how did we do that the first time)?
